	h2 System packages and manual build
	
	:markdown
		If your platform is not supported, building is as easy as checking out the [git repository](https://github.com/rejectedsoftware/dub) and running `./build.sh`. You need to have the development version of libcurl with SSL support installed. The resulting binary can then optionally be made available in `PATH`.

		For Arch Linux, Moritz Maxeiner maintains two AUR packages: [dub](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dub/) and [dub-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dub-git).

		Debian packages are available as part of Jordi Sayol's [D APT repository](http://d-apt.sourceforge.net/). Use `apt-get install dub`.

		[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) includes a DUB package by Chris Molozian. Use `brew install dub` or `brew install dub --HEAD`.


	h2 Precompiled binaries

	p The following table contains a list of precompiled binaries. The platform support is rather limited here for now and will be extended over time.

	p On Linux you need to have libcurl with SSL support installed.
